## Introduction
I first heard of Fedi and Fedimint at the beginning of 2024 during the first wave of Obi's appearances on different podcasts. Although I could not understand the concept at first (I mean chaumian mints, envelopes, signatures, e-cash, federations, guardians, etc. -> 😭), I sensed there is something important there. I spent the next six months watching every podcast and lecture on Fedimint I could find. In the end, I understood.

Later in 2024, during BTC Prague, I saw the above at Satoshi Rockamoto event :-D It was one of those moments in life when I was truly swept away. Personal integrity is one of my highest values and here is Obi, singing "Never enough, until we are all free!". I though to my self: Wow, this is a CEO, that just goes on stage and sings his heart out about what he believes and then wakes up the next day, goes to work, and does it. At that moment, I knew I want to work at Fedi.

Let me explain a little bit what I mean by personal integrity. There are a few better things in life then work hard, and at the end of the day be able to say: "What I did today had meaning." There is no greater meaning to work, than liberating humanity from FIAT slavery.

Yet at the time, I was not confident to land a job with you guys. I thought of myself as a programmer, and not a very good one. At the same time, I knew more about Bitcoin than 99% of humanity, but I wasn't confident in that knowledge either.

I believe Fedi is the best shot we've got at global Bitcoin adoption. I kept talking about Bitcoin to people around me for the last 5 years. They don't care. Not enough pain yet. However, the global south knew nothing but pain over the last hundreds of years. They will be the ones to understand the problems Bitcoin solves and adopt it the fastest. I find it amusing that, when it comes to money, the "developed" west is driving gasoline powered clunkers and communities of the Global South that elect to use Fedi are showing up in star-powered spaceships.

## Who am I?
My name is Matej Lukášik and I am located in Slovakia. You can find my CV [here](/about/) but just shortly: Ten years ago I learned to program web-applications using Ruby on Rails and that's what I did professionally the last ten years. The job makes for a good lifestyle, but I always felt there was something missing. We all know the coders who were born to do it, but this is not me. I can do it, and I'm pretty decent at it, but it's not truly, truly me. And that's OK. Today, I'm still working as a senior Ruby on Rails developer, located in Slovakia,  but I am looking to transition. Actually, I want to make two transitions at the same time: I want to move my time and energy onto the Bitcoin network (Jeff's a GOAT) and as per "not truly, truly me", I want to code less. Funny thing is that with the advent of LLMs, claude code and openclaw, I find building more fun than ever. I just never enjoyed the nitty, gritty of coding, algorithm optimization and data structures wizardry.

And that brings me to Fedi. I see you have 7 open positions at the moment. I don't have the amount and depth of experience to apply to any of them in particular. However, let me present my self to you and maybe you think I'm a good fit for one of them, or you can create one just for me ;-)

I asked openclaw to go through the positions and identify common themes. Here are a few comments on how am I doing on them.
#### Mission Aligned Mindset
Yes sir! Proud Bitcoin maxing, node running, GrapheneOS using, nostr onlying, matrix unplugged MF-er!
#### AI-Enabled Productivity

I am a programmer and it's been ten months since I written a line of code by hand. Just today I submitted a Github action, that nightly scans our error logs, creates GH issues out of what it finds, asks copilot to fix them and the solutions as PRs. I just started tinkering with OpenClaw.

#### Global South / Emerging Markets Focus
I lived in New Zealand for a year, South Korea for two years, and most recently I came back from Costa Rican jungle where I spent another two years. What I mean to say by that is that I have a lot of experience abroad, outside of my culture and can get along with almost anyone anywhere :-)
#### Community-First DNA
- I lead [twentyone.world](https://www.dvadsatjeden.org/) meetups in my city Trnava, Slovakia.
- I recently gave a self-organized [talk](https://www.malyberlin.sk/eventy/historia-penazi-od-musli-k-bitcoinu/) -> History of Money - From Shells to Bitcoin.
- I wrote a [few articles](https://www.dvadsatjeden.org/author/matej/) for the community (in english [here](https://matejlukasik.com/)).
That being said, my community actions spring from enthusiasm for the cause, rather than extroversion, or super strong need for social connection.
#### Outcomes Over Process
Yes

####  Cross-Functional Operators 

If there ever was a title I could wear, "Jack of all trades" would be it. 

As I stated above, it is not entirely clear to me, which one of your open positions I should pursue. However, I am a well articulated, technologically versed person, with a healthy dose of charisma. Maybe what we could do is setup a company wide openclaw server and systematically automatize processes across the organization. Everything, that can be automated, should be automated, so that machines do the repetive, tedious work and us humans can focus on creativity and most of all human connection.

What do you think?
