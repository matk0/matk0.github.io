## Profile

I am an experienced Ruby on Rails developer with a passion for building reliable and maintainable web applications. I take pride in writing clean, well-tested code and have strong foundations in back-end development, complemented by a solid understanding of front-end technologies like React, React Native, and Sass.

Over the years, I've led projects from simple ideas to fully functional products, always focusing on delivering practical solutions that work well for both users and businesses. I enjoy mentoring others, sharing knowledge, and fostering a collaborative environment where the team can grow together.

My toolbox includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and GraphQL, and I'm always looking for ways to improve processes and build better software. Clear communication, attention to detail, and a focus on quality are at the core of everything I do.
